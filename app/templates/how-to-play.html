                    Your goal is to try to craft the secret item from the ingredients in your inventory:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>You have <span class="bold">10</span> guesses</li>
                    <li>If your guess is incorrect, some of the grid may be coloured to give you feedback</li>
                    <li>If the square remains grey, the ingredient you placed here is not in the recipe, hmmm...</li>
                    <li>An orange square means that this ingredient is needed somewhere else on the grid, but not at the spot...</li>
                    <li>A green square means the ingredient placed on that square is correct and in the right spot!</li>
                </ol>
